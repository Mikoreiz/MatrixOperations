This project was made for fun. I got the inspiration during my Applied Linear Equations class when I was learning about Matrix operations. A couple of my classmates said that the operations we were doing were fun but "were probably hard to code" so I made this to prove them wrong (and to also help on my homework so I don't have to manually solver everything :).
